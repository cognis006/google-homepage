What I've Learned

I've learned the usefulness of the css position property in creating the desired layout. I also learned that the float css property can be used
in creating a navigation bar that have buttons on either end. And lastly, "auto" is not a valid value for the padding property.

What I've demonstrated ...

1. Several ways to apply css using various selector methods
2. How to group elements using both non semantic and semantic tags
3. How to create a navigation bar via inline-block and floats
4. Use the dev tool to assess element dimensions and other qualities
5. How to place images
6. How to apply pseudo-classes
7. Use the position:absolute property to affix the second navigation bar at the bottom
8. How to center things
